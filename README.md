# stageR

## stage-wise analysis of high-throughput genomic data with omnibus and posthoc tests

This is the repository for the stageR package. stageR allows user-friendly automated stage-wise analysis of high-throughput genomic data.

See the [Bioconductor website](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/stageR.html) to install the package through Bioconductor.
To install the package from the GitHub repository in R, please use

```
library(devtools)
install_github("statOmics/stageR")
```

The repository containing all code required to reproduce the analyses in the paper can be found [here](http://www.github.com/statOmics/stageWiseTestingPaper).


Note, that we discovered a bug in the ‘holm’ and ‘user’ corrections for the ‘stageWiseAdjustment’ function that was introduced when making changes for Bioconductor submission. The bug was present in version 0.99.08 until version 1.1.1. It was also present in the Bioconductor 3.6 release branch.
